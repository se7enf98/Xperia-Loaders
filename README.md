# Note
1. Attention!\
   Emergency loaders (e.g. Firehose loaders) require Sony SAKE Auth for devices from 2016 and later. [Useless/Unusable until a public exploit is released]
2. About S1BOOTs for OLD Xperias:\
   Since the S1 bootloader on older Xperias (2012 and earlier) was usually not released in every firmware version and was essentially an important and rare file, an attempt has been made to include the S1BOOT file for these devices in this repository. However, the main focus of this repository is on S1-Loaders and S1-Preloaders (aka Sony Firehose Loaders).
3. Missing Files:\
   The list of items we don't have and need is very long.\
If you have any valuable files, I would be happy if you could share them here :)\
Any files such as old bootloaders, emergency loaders (like Firehose), etc.
